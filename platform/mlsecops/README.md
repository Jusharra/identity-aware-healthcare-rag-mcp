# MLSecOps Platform

Reusable foundation for secure ML labs:

- Base ML project template
- Data quality and security configs
- Drift and model monitoring scaffolding
- Tests for MLSecOps concerns (poisoning, leakage, etc.)

Every ML-related project should start by copying or referencing
`templates/base-ml-project`.
